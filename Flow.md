Variables


scores is array numbers

- a loop cyles through the array
- the loop or loops...
	- counts each grade (A, B, C, D, F) and puts it in a variable
		- find a function that does this, or write one.
		- or a loop for each grade?
		for while loop?  count occurences (i = 90, i < 100)

	- compares each grade and puts the lowest in a variable
		- compate two numbers, keep the lowest and compare it to the next number.

	- compares each grade and puts the highest in a variable
		- compare two numbers, keep the highest and compare it to the next number.
	- maybe combine these two loops by pushing each number to either high or low?

	####Counting Grades
	- Put scale in an array or object [60, 70, 80, 90]
	- compare the middle value of the array (70) with the grade var.
		- var < 80, no then, var < 90, yes=A, no=B.
	- go up or down as needed


-------------------------- no, too long...
	If var is... 
	- >= 90 then A
	- >= 80 and < 90 then b, count
	- >= 70 and < 80 then c, count
	- >= 60 and < 70 then d, count
	- < 60 then F, count
